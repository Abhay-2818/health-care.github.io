            <h4>COVID-19 Vaccination
                Two vaccines were approved to prevent COVID-19 in India by the DGCI — COVAXIN and Covishield:</h4>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><b>COVAXIN: </b>The first vaccine for COVID-19 in India that was developed in partnership with the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research)</li>
           <li><b>2. Covishield:</b> Developed by the University of Oxford, along with AstraZeneca and manufactured by Serum Institute of India for Indian residents</li>
            </ol>
            <p > Right now, both the vaccines are being rolled out mainly to healthcare and frontline workers, individuals over 50 years, and high-risk patients (people below 50 years with comorbid conditions).

                <br><br> Currently, getting a COVID-19 vaccine is at the top of everybody’s minds. Therefore, it is normal for most of us to have 
                questions about the process, especially what to expect before, during and after COVID-19 Vaccination at some point in the
                 future. Here’s what you have to know, if you wish to be prepared for what is to come.</P>

            <h3>How to register for getting COVID Vaccination?</h3>
            <strong>Who are now eligible for COVID Vaccine?</strong>
            <p>Everyone above 60 years of age and those over 45 years with comorbidities are eligible. However, to expand the coverage of vaccinations and scale up the fight against COVID-19, the Government of India has decided to open the vaccination drive for everyone above the age of 45 years starting from April 1. 

                After April 1, 2021, anyone who is above 45 years can get the vaccination. There will be no need for medical certificates as evidence of co-morbidity conditions, as the government had specified earlier for the second phase of vaccination.</p>
            <strong>Can the COVID-19 vaccine affect my body during any medical procedure?</strong>
            <p>The DCGI (Drug Controller General of India) has approved two vaccines for emergency use – Covishied, developed by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin, produced by Bharat Biotech. Both vaccines are considered safe for those with a history of, or those undergoing medical procedure unless they have a contraindication to any kind of vaccination. 

                Make sure you consult a doctor and inform them about any medical conditions you may have. Share your medical history, allergies to certain medication, and also medical procedures you may have undergone or are undergoing before taking the vaccine. Experts advise you to follow the safety measure like wearing a mask or maintaining social distancing even after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
            <strong>What precautions should be followed during your appointment for vaccination?</strong>
            <p>The following precautions are compulsory during your appointment for vaccination:

                Follow all the hand hygiene recommendations and:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a mask </li>
                <li> Stay at least six feet away from others</li>
                <li>Follow all respiratory hygiene/cough etiquettes</li>
            </ul>
