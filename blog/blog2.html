        <h3>After a brief lull, the number of  COVID-19 cases is once again rising in India, signaling that the country maybe on the verge of a second wave of infection. 

            While reinfections and easing of lockdown restrictions are cited, emergence of new variants are also said to be the potential driving factors
             for a sharp rise in coronavirus infections in India.</h3>

                <strong>Understanding COVID-19 Variants</strong>
                <p>Viruses change constantly through mutation. Therefore, new variants of the virus are expected to occur over time. While sometimes the new variants emerge and disappear, other times these new variants emerge and persist. Numerous variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are emerging and are being documented globally during this pandemic.

                Scientists are currently studying closely about these variants to learn more and determine whether they spread more easily. So far, studies suggest that antibodies produced through vaccination with currently authorized vaccines recognize these variants. However, this is being closely investigated by scientists and more studies are underway</p>
                <strong>COVID-19 Variants Circulating Worldwide</strong>
                <p>Numerous variants of COVID-19 have been identified. The most well-known variants are variants that was discovered first in the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa. A variant from Brazil is also receiving attention. Lately, A new double mutant strain of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been detected in India. Each variant arose independently and all have unique mutations and mutations in common</p>
               
                <strong>COVID-19 Variants Circulating in India</strong>
                <p>Multiple variants of COVID-19 have been detected from samples collected from all across India. The variants include those that have originated locally and others that have been brought by travellers from other countries.

                    The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a grouping of 10 National Laboratories established by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, detected VOCs (variants of concern) in several positive samples. However, the genomic variants of various viruses are actually a natural phenomenon and are found in most of the countries across the world.
                    
                    Although VOCs and a new ‘double mutant’ variant have been detected in India, the health ministry clarified that they have not been detected in numbers sufficient to either establish or explain the rapid increase in cases in some of the Indian states. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) informed that a total of 771 variants were found from over 10,000 samples. These include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>736 samples positive for viruses of the UK (B.1.1.7) lineage</li>
                    <li>34 samples found positive for viruses of the South African (B.1.351) lineage</li>
                    <li>1 sample found positive for viruses of the Brazilian (P.1) lineage.</li>
                </ul>
            
                 <strong>Conclusion</strong>
                 <p>An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases can put more strain on health care resources. Therefore, continuing to reduce the chances of exposure is the best defense against the variants. Continue to wear a mask, avoid crowded places and maintain physical distance, wash your hand frequently and last but not the least, get vaccinated when you get your turn . </p>
